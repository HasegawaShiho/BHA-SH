## About Me
I specialize in modern and contemporary art theory (art history, design studies). I am particularly interested in the intersection of post-modern artistic expression and technology/natural science, from the perspectives of visual culture (film, video), media art, and Bio-art / Bio-design. The completed doctoral programme at the Graduate School of Cultural Sciences, Saitama University without a degree. Since 2018, working at the Keio Museum Commons (KeMCo), which is a Japanese university museum.

My current interests are visual languages by microbiome, contact points between non-human and human, "planing" in Bio-art, the function of DIY Bio culture as an intersection, and so on, from the view point of humanities.
