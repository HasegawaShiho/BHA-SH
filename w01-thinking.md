## What is Life? How would you define it, can you actually define it?

What is "life?" Through discussions with members on last Thursday, several important elements were identified.
Autopoiesis, variability, mutation, propagation, membranes, metabolism, autonomous movement (external and internal)...

Three basic principles of living organisms were generally mentioned.
-Metabolism (energy exchange)
ãƒ»Distinction between inside and outside membranes
Genetic replicability

However, just as there is debate over whether viruses are biological or inanimate, the emergence of semi-life forms such as artificial life and semi-living materials has been actively developing in the past 50 years.
When talking about life, the environment and nature are discussed in relation to interrelated systems, such as internal systems (such as metabolism) and external systems (ecosystems).
Life is a phenomenon with time, but it can be thought of as a physical entity with a vertical axis of temporal transition and a horizontal axis of areal expansion.

At this stage, we have a certain definition of "life," but this definition may be expanded in the future.
In the future, there may be a difference between the biological definition and the cultural and social "life" definition.
